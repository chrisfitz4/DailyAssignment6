gym application
This application keeps track of the items a gym has purchased and 
allows for the gym to purchase more. 
A ListView shows both of these entrees to keep them scrollable and the application neat-looking
WHen the items in the available-to-purchase listview are clicked, startActivityForResult is
called, and a new activity starts, letting the user purchase more of the item selected

This uses: ListViews, SharedPreferences (to remember what was purchased),activities and intents,
Glide (woohoo!), and helper layouts
